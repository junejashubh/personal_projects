Date: Daily data.
Country: Country where the pollution is recorded.
City: City within the country.
Water Source: Name of the river, lake, or other water body being monitored.
pH Level: Acidity or alkalinity of the water.
Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L): Oxygen available in water, crucial for aquatic life.
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD): Amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic organisms to break down organic material.
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): Measures the total amount of oxygen required to chemically oxidize organic and inorganic compounds in water.
Nitrates (mg/L): Levels of nitrates in the water, which affect water quality and may lead to eutrophication.
Phosphates (mg/L): Presence of phosphates, often a result of agricultural runoff or sewage.
Lead (mg/L): Heavy metal contamination.
Mercury (mg/L): Another heavy metal that can accumulate in aquatic life.
Pollution Index (0-100): An aggregate index to measure the overall pollution level, where 0 is clean and 100 is extremely polluted.

Questions:	
1	For each city, determine the typical acidity level of the water. Which city has the most acidic water on average?
2	In the USA, examine the overall dissolved oxygen levels in water sources. What are the typical values across all records?
3	Focus on data from Brazil. Which city experiences the highest pollution levels over the 5-year period?
4	In Mumbai, identify the date when water pollution was at its worst.
5	For each country, determine how many pollution records were collected. Which country has the most entries?
6	Compare the average water quality for rivers versus lakes in terms of biological oxygen demand. Which type of water source has more organic matter?
7	Examine how pollution levels have changed in different countries over the years. Which country has seen the largest increase in pollution?
8	Investigate nitrate levels across various water sources in different countries. How do they compare?
9	For New York, track how water pollution has changed over time. Is there a noticeable trend over the 5-year period?
10	Look at how pollution levels change throughout the year in each city. Which cities experience the most significant seasonal variations?
11	Examine the relationship between pollution and various water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, and nitrates. Which parameter seems to be most closely linked with pollution levels?
12	Track pollution trends over time for multiple cities. Which cities have improved or worsened over the 5 years?
13	Identify any unusual or extreme values for the pH level in each city. On which days did water acidity or alkalinity differ the most from typical values?
14	For each country and water source, find out which combinations have the worst pollution levels.
15	Investigate how heavy metal contamination (Lead and Mercury) has changed over the 5-year period. Are any cities seeing an increase or decrease in contamination?
16	Assign each record to a pollution severity category based on overall pollution levels. How do cities compare in terms of the proportion of records in the highest severity category?
17	Look at the seasonal patterns of pollution for each city. Are there specific times of year when pollution tends to rise or fall?
18	Create a risk index based on a combination of biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and nitrates. Which city is most at risk based on this index?
19	Predict future pollution levels for one city based on past data. What could the pollution level be next year?
